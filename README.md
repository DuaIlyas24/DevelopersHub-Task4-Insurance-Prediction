# Task 4: Insurance Claim Prediction 🏥

## 📌 Project Overview
In this project, I developed a **Linear Regression** model to predict medical insurance charges based on individual health and demographic factors. This task focuses on understanding how different variables contribute to the cost of insurance premiums.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn.
- **Regression Analysis**: Built a model to predict continuous numerical values (charges).
- **Feature Selection**: Analyzed the influence of age, BMI, and smoking status.

## 📊 Key Insights & Observations
After performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and training the model, I observed the following:
* **The Smoker Factor**: Smoking has a much higher impact on insurance costs than BMI or age. Smokers generally pay significantly higher premiums regardless of their BMI.
* **Linear Relationship**: Insurance charges tend to increase linearly with age, but the increase is much steeper for individuals with high BMI and smoking habits.
* **Model Accuracy**: The model was evaluated using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** to measure the distance between predicted and actual costs.

## 📂 How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `Task4_Insurance_Claim_Prediction.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter.
3. Run the cells to see the regression plots and error metrics.
